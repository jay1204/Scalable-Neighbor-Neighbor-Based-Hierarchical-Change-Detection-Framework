# Scalable-Neighbor-Neighbor-Based-Hierarchical-Change-Detection-Framework

### A novel time series similarity based change detection framework for identifying inter-annual changes by exploiting phenological properties of growing crops from satellite time series imagery.



The algorithm implementation is written in c++ with CUDA to accelerate the computation.

## Description
The detailed description of the algorithm is in the ChangeDetection ppt slides. For detailed information, please contact me(zchen22@ncsu.edu).

## Prerequisites for running the program
Hardware: CUDA enabled Graphical card, Main Memory >= 8 GB  
Library: CUDA library installed

## Run the code
1. make file
2. Run main
3. Using generate_change_map to plot the graph
